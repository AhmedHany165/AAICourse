    "(DBNs). Here you will see how DBNs work using a mixture of Excel, and the Python Pomegranate\n",
    "package. In particular, you will carry out a mixture of filtering and prediction tasks on the umbrella\n",

    "## Task 1: Excel for filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "The spreadsheet `umbrella-filtering.xls` that can be found on Blackboard models the umbrella example over over the first 2 days.\n",
    "On the top line, the probability of rain for `Day 0` is the prior probability (see Slides 26 and 49 in lecture 8).\n",
    "At the bottom of the sheet are the conditional probability tables for the transition model and the sensor model. The predicted probability for rain on `Day 1` (top) is computed from the probability for `Day 0` and the transition model. This is exactly as on Slide 49 (and 53).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the filtered probability, we have to bring in information about whether we saw an umbrella or not. The filtered probability of rain for `Day 1` (middle of the sheet) is computed by combining the predicted probability for `Day 1`, the sensor model, and what we know about umbrellas. This gives the results you see on Slide 50 (and 53).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are two versions of the filtered probability. The raw values which we get directly from the calculation, and the normalized values (raw values scaled so they add to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look at what happens if you change the probability of umbrella/not umbrella. Currently the values say you see an umbrella (probability of umbrella is 1 and that of not umbrella is 0). What happens if you don’t see an umbrella (probability of umbrella is 0 and that of not umbrella is 1)? What about if you have no information (probability of umbrella is 0.5 and that of not umbrella is 0.5)?**"
