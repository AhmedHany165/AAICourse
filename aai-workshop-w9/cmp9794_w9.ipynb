    "\n",
    "This workshop relates to Lecture 09. In that lecture, we discussed Dynamic Bayesian Networks\n",
    "(DBNs). Here you will see how DBNs work using a mixture of Excel, and the Python Pomegranate\n",
    "package. In particular, you will carry out a mixture of filtering, prediction and smoothing tasks on\n",
    "the umbrella network that we studied in the lecture."

    "## Task 1: Excel for filtering and prediction (redux)\n",
    "\n",
    "The spreadsheet `umbrella-smoothing.xls` that can be found on Blackboard models the umbrella example over the first 3 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tab/sheet `Filtering D3` provides the solution to two of the problems from last week. First, it gives an answer to the problem from Task 4 on predicting rain. The upper cells of the sheet provide a prediction forward until `Day 10` (when the predicted probability of Rain has converged to `0.5`). \n",
    "\n",
    "**BTW, why do we know that this means it had converged?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the tab/sheet also provides the computation of the filtered probability of rain for `Day 3`. This is the answer to the problem from Task 5. (Note that the tab/sheet `Filtering D2` provides predictions from `Day 3` onwards — it filters to `Day 2` and then predicts — so provides another prediction forward to `Day 10`.)\n"

    "\n",
    "The smoothed probability is then just the product of the forward and backward messages, normalised. This is the calculation on Slide 27 (and 28).\n",
